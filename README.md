# UMFS
**Unsupervised Feature Selection with Binary Hashing**

**Data**
1. single-view datasetsï¼šsingle-label and multi-label datasets  
2. multi-view datasets

**UMFS**
Unsupervised Multi-label Feature Selection  

**MUMFS**
Multo-view extension: Multi-view Unsupervised Multi-label Feature Selection  

**Evaluation**
1. Clustering task: perform k-means  
2. Classification task: perform SVM (download libSVM package) and ML-KNN (use MLKNN package)  

**Evaluation Metrics**
clustering: accuracy(ACC) and Normalized Mutual Information(NMI)(run 'ClusteringMeasure.m')  
classification: accuracy; multi-label classification: One-Error and Average Precision.
